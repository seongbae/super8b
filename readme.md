<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://super8b.com)

With the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) replacing the old APFT, I wanted to contribute to the military community and help them pass the ACFT.  Those in charge of putting together PT plans do a great job but often times their hard work stays on their computer and is not shared with the greater community. I built this tool so that their great work can be easily replicated and shared with many others.

This tool allows you to:
* Create long-term workout plans 
* Duplicate existing workout plans created by others and make them your own
* Allow others to subscribe to your workout plan to see the daily workouts from the dashboard

To help understand the terminology used in the tool, a workout plan consists of multiple workouts and each workout consists of a set of exercises.  Each exercise can have sets and repetitions.  

### Built With
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
